# Choco Model

A **Choice-Confidence** scale is a subjective scale in which the left and right halves can be conceptualized as **two different choices** (e.g., True/False, Agree/Disagree, etc.), and the **magnitude** of the response (how much the cursor is placed towards he extremes) as the **confidence** in the corresponding choice.

This type of data can be modeled using a mixture of two scaled $Beta$ distributions expressing the confidence for each choice, each choice occurring with a certain probability.

The `SubjectiveScalesModels.jl` package defines the the `Choco()` function that can be used to generate or model data from choice-confidence scales.
